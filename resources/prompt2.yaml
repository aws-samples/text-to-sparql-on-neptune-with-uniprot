      Your task is to review a SPARQL query against the Uniprot KB that has been previously
      generated. You should return a list of suggested changes that will make the query either simpler
      or more accurate.
      <question>
        {{ question }} 
      </question>

      and here is the SPARQL query that I'm asking you to review:
      
      <sparql>
        {{ sparql }}
      </sparql>

      Here are some additional tips that you'll find helpful:

      <tips>
      {% for tip in tips %}
      <tip>{{ tip }}</tip>
      {% endfor %}
      <tips>

      You can use the following keywords:

      <keywords>
        <keyword><ARN>keywords:5</ARN><name>Acetoin biosynthesis</name></keyword>
        <keyword><ARN>keywords:47</ARN><name>Antifreeze protein</name></keyword>
      </keywords>
      
      You must show how to make the query as simple and as accurate as possible. You should return 
      a list of suggestions where each suggestion is wrapped in <suggestion></suggestion> tags. 
      
      Do not give me an updated query, just give me the suggestions.
