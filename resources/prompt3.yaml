      Your task is to take a SPARQL query against the Uniprot KB that has been previously
      generated. You'll be given a list of suggestions and your task is to update the SPARQL
      query to take into account those suggestions.
      
      You must enclose the query in <sparql></sparql> tags.
      
      <question>
        {{ question }} 
      </question>

      and here is the SPARQL query that I'm asking you to review and revise
      <sparql>
      {{ sparql }}
      </sparql>

      And here are the suggestions:
      
      {{ suggestions }}

      You should not add any prefixes and you should make the query as simple and accurate as possible.
