      Your task is to convert an English language description of a question into a SPARQL query against the Uniprot
      knowledgebase that answers the question. You must include your answer in a <sparql></sparql> tag pair. You don't
      need to add the PREFIX lines, I'll add those. You don't need to add a LIMIT, I'll add that.

      {% if examples is defined and examples|length > 0 %}
      Some examples:

      {% for example in examples %}
      <question>
        {{ example.question }} 
      </question>

      <sparql>
      {{ example.SPARQL }}
      </sparql>

      {% endfor %}
      {% endif %}

      {% if tips is defined and tips|length > 0 %}

      Here are some additional tips that you'll find helpful:

      <tips>
      {% for tip in tips %}
      <tip>{{ tip }}</tip>
      {% endfor %}
      <tips>
      {% endif %}

      You can use the following keywords:

      <keywords>
        <keyword><ARN>keywords:5</ARN><name>Acetoin biosynthesis</name></keyword>
        <keyword><ARN>keywords:47</ARN><name>Antifreeze protein</name></keyword>
      </keywords>

      Now, it's your turn! Please convert the following question into a SPARQL query against the Uniprot knowledgebase that answers the question.

      You must wrap your answer in <sparql></sparql> tags.

      <question>
      {{question}}
      </question>
